🌍 Task 1 – Student Grade Tracker  
Student Grade Management Console App using Java (Task 1 – CodeAlpha Internship)  

This project is developed as part of my **CodeAlpha Internship (September 2025)**.  
The goal of this task is to build a console-based Java program to input, manage, and analyze student grades efficiently.  

📌 Project Objective
- Input student names and scores
- Automatically calculate grades based on scores
- Display a summary report of all students
- Calculate class statistics: average, highest, and lowest scores
- Use arrays or ArrayLists to store and manage student data

🗃 Dataset / API
- No external dataset required
- User inputs data via console

🧠 Core Functionality
- Accept student name and score from user
- Calculate grades automatically:
  - `A` : 90 – 100
  - `B` : 80 – 89
  - `C` : 70 – 79
  - `D` : 60 – 69
  - `F` : Below 60
- Display all student details in a tabular format
- Calculate class average, highest score, and lowest score

🧪 Workflow
1. Enter the number of students  
2. Input names and scores for each student  
3. Store student objects in an array  
4. Calculate grades for each student  
5. Compute class statistics  
6. Display summary report and statistics in the console
